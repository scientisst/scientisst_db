# scientisst_db

[![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/scientisst_db.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/scientisst_db)

Open source Flutter plugin that implements a NoSQL document-based local database.
The syntax of this package is similar to other well-known databases, organizing its data in collections and documents.

Made by the [ScientISST](https://scientisst.com) team.

## Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scientisst_db: ^0.1.2
```

## Architecture

![Architecture scheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scientisst/scientisst_db/master/doc/scientisst_db_scheme.png)

The database stores data in the Applications Documents Directory, provided by [`path_provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider).

The database directory is stored in a root folder called `scientisst_db`.

The first layer is constituted only by `collections`, which have their corresponding directory. Each `collection` directory is constituted by three separate folders: `collections`, `documents`, and `metadata`. The `collection` children `documents` are stored in the `documents` folder, where each `document` has its separate file with a filename corresponding to its `ObjectId`. The `ObjectId` is generated according to MongoDB's [standard](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/) or can be an arbitrary `String`. The `document` data is stored in a JSON formatted text file.

Each `document` has a corresponding `metadata` file which is stored in the `metadata` folder inside the `collection` directory, with a filename equal to the `ObjectId`, encoded also in the JSON format.

A `document` can store `collections` (sub-collections), which are stored in a folder inside the `collections` directory under the parent `collection` directory. This folder has the same filename as the `document` `ObjectId` and it follows the same `collection` structure.

## Examples

See the full example [here](https://github.com/scientisst/scientisst_db/blob/master/example/example.dart).

Some basic examples:

---

Add a document to a collection:

```dart
DocumentReference doc = await ScientISSTdb.instance.collection("movies").add(
  {
    "title": "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind",
    "year": 2004,
    "characters": [
      "Joel",
      "Clementine",
    ],
  },
);
```

---

Update a document:

```dart
await doc.update(
  {
    "title": "Hello world",
  },
);
```

---

Delete a document:

```dart
await ScientISSTdb.instance.collection("movies").document("507f1f77bcf86cd7994ca120").delete();
```

---

Get all documents from a collection:

```dart
await ScientISSTdb.instance.collection("movies").getDocuments();
```

---

Order documents by field value:

```dart
await ScientISSTdb.instance
    .collection("movies")
    .orderBy("year", ascending: false)
    .getDocuments();
```
